# portfolio
Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm absolutely exuberant to have you here.
All the projects within I wrote the entire codebase for, however I've only included various snippets for obvious reasons.
I've also included some screen caps so you can visualize what I've done, some for the code included, some for the code I didn't include.
Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about projects I've worked on/maintained.
